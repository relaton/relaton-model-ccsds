= Relaton CCSDS Bibliographic Data Model

This bibliographic model is developed to consolidate and standardize
the data model used for bibliographic and citation purposes.

This model is meant to be fully compatible with ISO 690 and
ISO TC 46's (and SC 4, SC 9) work on bibliography.

This model inherits from the Biblioraphic model https://github.com/relaton/relaton-models

NOTE: The modeled components represent a subset of the XML model; omitted
elements are implementation details that are not important in the generation of
bibliographic data.
